Bohak Yoon is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry and Materials Science and Engineering at Baylor University.
He completed his postdoctoral training in Theoretical Chemistry under the mentorship of [Prof. Gregory A. Voth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregory_A._Voth) at the University of Chicago. Previously, he earned his Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin, working with [Prof. G. S. Hwang](https://che.utexas.edu/people/faculty/hwang). Bohak’s scientific journey began in New York, where his passion for mathematics was sparked during middle school at [North Country School](https://northcountryschool.org) in Lake Placid. He later expanded his focus to chemistry and physics at [The Masters School](https://www.mastersny.org) in White Plains, NY. This strong foundation led him to Lehigh University to major in Chemical Engineering, where he discovered his love for research and teaching under [Prof. Mark A. Snyder](https://engineering.lehigh.edu/faculty/mark-snyder) and [Prof. Steven McIntosh](https://engineering.lehigh.edu/faculty/steven-mcintosh). Bohak’s research focuses on developing and applying theoretical chemistry and multiscale modeling at the intersection of biology, energy, and sustainability."
