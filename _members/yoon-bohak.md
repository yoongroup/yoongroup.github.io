Bohak Yoon is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry with a joint appointment in Materials Science and Engineering at Baylor University.
He conducted his postdoctoral research in Theoretical Chemistry under the mentorship of [Prof. Gregory A. Voth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregory_A._Voth) at the University of Chicago. Previously, he earned his Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering from the University of Texas at Austin, where he worked with [Prof. G. S. Hwang](https://che.utexas.edu/people/faculty/hwang).

Bohak’s journey began in Lake Placid, New York, during middle school at [North Country School](https://northcountryschool.org), where he was captivated by the joy of mathematics. His passion for chemistry, physics, and math further grew during high school at [The Masters School](https://www.mastersny.org) in Dobbs Ferry, New York. Driven by a desire to integrate all three disciplines, he pursued a B.S. in Chemical Engineering at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, where he discovered his love for research and teaching under [Prof. Mark A. Snyder](https://engineering.lehigh.edu/faculty/mark-snyder) and [Prof. Steven McIntosh](https://engineering.lehigh.edu/faculty/steven-mcintosh). Bohak’s research focuses on developing and applying multiscale modeling and AI/ML at the intersection of physics, chemistry, and biology to address challenges in energy and sustainability.
