We're excited to share our first paper published since joining KAIST, now out in [ACS Catalysis](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acscatal.5c08472)!

This work features our former postdoc, Shedrack, as co-first author, with Bohak as co-corresponding author. This project is a culmination of beautiful collaboration between theory/computation and experiment, initiated and led by our amazing collaborator, Dr. Jai Hyun Koh at KIST.

A huge thanks to Dr. Koh and the paper's co-lead author, Young In (Koh Group), for driving the experiment of this research!
