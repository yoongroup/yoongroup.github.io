Harnessing and implementing artificial intelligence (AI) and neural network models for complex physicochemical processes are essential for achieving more realistic and efficient simulations. These models, while preserving important physical principles, enable precise predictions of material behavior over extended spatial and temporal scalesâ€”something traditional methods often struggle to achieve. By utilizing AI, we can accelerate the discovery and optimization of new materials and processes, thereby addressing complex challenges in chemistry, materials science, and engineering. Ultimately, this approach enhances our ability to conduct scalable and accurate simulations, bringing theoretical insights closer to real-world applications.

Our group employs path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) to capture essential quantum effects, such as zero-point energy (ZPE) retention, quantum tunneling, and nuclear delocalization, which play a crucial role in chemical reactivity, catalysis, and condensed-phase molecular systems. We utilize ring-polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) to compute reaction rates and dynamical properties while incorporating quantum fluctuations, and centroid molecular dynamics (CMD) to extract quantum-corrected correlation functions for transport and thermodynamic properties. These methods allow us to investigate isotope effects, proton and hydrogen transfer, phase transitions, and nuclear quantum effects in materials and aqueous systems, which are not accessible through classical simulations. By systematically incorporating quantum nuclear behavior, our approach provides a more accurate molecular-level understanding of reaction mechanisms, charge transport, and structural dynamics in complex environments. Our work bridges the gap between classical and quantum models, offering deeper insights into fundamental processes that govern sustainable energy systems, catalysis, and environmental chemistry.

Developing and applying multiscale simulations, from quantum mechanics to coarse-grained molecular dynamics and continuum scale modeling, is essential for addressing energy and sustainability challenges. These simulations enable us to understand and optimize complex processes across different scales, from atomic-level reactions to large-scale system behavior, which is critical for designing efficient energy conversion and storage systems. By integrating and connecting insights from various scales with enhanced sampling methods, we can develop more sustainable materials and technologies that minimize environmental impact, such as advanced biological and catalytic processes. Additionally, this approach helps in predicting the performance and lifetime of energy-related materials and systems under realistic operating conditions, guiding the development of future sustainable solutions.

Studying biomolecular modeling is crucial because it allows us to understand the intricate mechanisms of enzymatic reactions at a molecular level, which are essential for life processes. Through multiscale computational simulations, we can investigate and visualize how enzymes interact with substrates, predict reaction outcomes, and identify key factors influencing enzyme efficiency and specificity. This understanding aids in the design of novel drugs and therapeutic interventions by targeting specific enzymes linked to diseases. Additionally, it provides insights into enzyme evolution and aids in the development of industrial catalysts for more sustainable chemical processes.
